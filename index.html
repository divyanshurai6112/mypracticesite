        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>I like to study various case studies on different businesses. Currently an intern for the Consultant at <b><i>HighRadius Corporation (Houston, TX)</b></i>. I like to think about different strategies the client/company can use to tackle their problems at an ease. I also like to code at times, just like I designed the very website you're getting to know me from.</p>

        <h3>Football/Soccer</h3>
        <p>I have always been very passionate about Football. Played at some level. I was also the captain of my team. We were the finalists in Zonal Level. Hard Luck, we lost the final. That day I learnt that good leader not always leads the team to victory but also when the team loses, stands with them, shoulder to shoulder. I've been playing football since i was 7 years old. I can school you in this :)     Just kidding.</p>
